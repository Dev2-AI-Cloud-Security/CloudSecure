Project Goals

Integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time threat detection and response.
Utilize cloud infrastructure for scalability and resilience.
Implement containerized applications for consistent deployment.
Automate security updates via CI/CD pipelines.
Enhance user experience through intuitive design.

Architecture
The framework is built on a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and scalability:

AI Engine:
Machine learning models for anomaly detection and threat prediction.
Processes logs and network traffic to identify potential threats in real-time.


Cloud Infrastructure:
Hosted on AWS (EC2, S3, ECR for container registry).
Scalable compute and storage for AI workloads and application hosting.


Containerized Applications:
Applications are containerized using Docker.
Kubernetes orchestrates containers for high availability and load balancing.


Automation:
Ansible manages configuration and automates security updates.
CI/CD pipeline ensures seamless deployment of updates.


User Interface:
Designed using Figma for intuitive user experience.
Provides dashboards for monitoring threats and managing security policies.



Workflow

Threat Detection:
AI engine analyzes logs and traffic, identifying anomalies.
Alerts are generated and sent to the dashboard.


Response Automation:
Ansible scripts apply security patches or update firewall rules.
Kubernetes scales pods as needed to handle increased load.


Continuous Updates:
CI/CD pipeline builds, tests, and deploys updates to the application and AI models.
AWS infrastructure ensures zero-downtime deployments.



Technologies Used

AWS: Cloud infrastructure (EC2, S3, ECR, EKS for Kubernetes).
Kubernetes: Container orchestration for scalability and reliability.
Docker: Containerization of AI engine and applications.
Ansible: Configuration management and automation of security updates.
Figma: User experience design for the dashboard and tools.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.
Python: Primary language for AI model development (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch).
Node.js/React: Backend and frontend for the dashboard.

Prerequisites
To set up and run this project locally or on your cloud environment, ensure you have the following:

AWS account with access to EC2, S3, ECR, and EKS.
Docker installed (docker --version to verify).
Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) and a running cluster (e.g., via AWS EKS).
Ansible installed (ansible --version to verify).
Figma account for accessing UI designs.
GitHub repository with Actions enabled for CI/CD.
Python 3.8+ for AI model development.
Node.js 18+ for the dashboard.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cybersecurity-framework.git
cd ai-cybersecurity-framework

2. Configure AWS Infrastructure

Set up an AWS EKS cluster for Kubernetes:eksctl create cluster --name ai-cyber-cluster --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t3.medium --nodes 3


Configure AWS credentials:aws configure


Push container images to AWS ECR:aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker build -t ai-cyber-app .
docker tag ai-cyber-app:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-cyber-app:latest
docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-cyber-app:latest



3. Deploy with Kubernetes

Apply Kubernetes manifests:kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml


Verify pods are running:kubectl get pods



4. Automate with Ansible

Run Ansible playbook to configure security settings:ansible-playbook playbooks/security-config.yaml -i inventory


Ensure the inventory file points to your EKS nodes.

5. Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Workflow file (/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) automates build and deployment:name: Deploy to EKS
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t ai-cyber-app .
          docker tag ai-cyber-app:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-cyber-app:latest
          docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ai-cyber-app:latest
      - name: Deploy to EKS
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
          kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml


Add AWS credentials as GitHub Secrets (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

6. Access the Dashboard

Get the Kubernetes service URL:kubectl get svc ai-cyber-service -o wide


Access the dashboard at the provided external IP or domain (e.g., http://<EXTERNAL_IP>).
Use Figma designs to understand the UI layout: Figma Link (replace with your Figma project link).

Usage

Monitor Threats: Access the dashboard to view real-time threat alerts generated by the AI engine.
Manage Policies: Use the UI to update security policies, which Ansible applies automatically.
Scale as Needed: Kubernetes handles scaling; adjust replicas in k8s/deployment.yaml if necessary.
