# CloudSecure
The increasing sophistication of cyber threats necessitates the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity solutions. This project aims to design and implement
an AI-driven cybersecurity framework leveraging cloud infrastructure, containerized
applications, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure seamless and automated security updates.
The solution will utilize AWS for cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes for orchestration, and
Ansible for configuration management and automation. Additionally, Figma will be used
for user experience modelling to enhance the usability of the cybersecurity tools
developed.
